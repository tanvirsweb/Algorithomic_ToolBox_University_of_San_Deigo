Solving Programming Challenges
TOTAL POINTS 5
1.
Question 1
What will you typically need to implement yourself in the programming assignments if you program in C++, Java or Python?
=Just the solution of the problem.

We will provide starter files for C++, Java and Python. In most cases, these will contain the implementation of reading the input and writing the output, and you will only need to implement the correct solution to the problem.

2.
Question 2
Your program in C, C++ or Java thinks that the product of numbers 5000050000 and 5000050000 is equal to -1794967296âˆ’1794967296. What is the most probable reason?

1 / 1 point

The problem statement is wrong.
Compiler error.
==Integer overflow.
The input data is incorrect.


3.
Question 3
Which tests should you perform before submitting a solution to the programming assignment?
==
Test on the examples from the problem statement. Then make a few other small tests, solve them manually and check that your program outputs the correct answer. Generate a big input and launch your program to check that it works fast enough and doesn't consume too much memory. Test for corner cases: smallest allowed values and largest allowed values of all input parameters, equal numbers in the input, very long strings, etc. Then make a stress test. After all these tests passed, submit the solution.

4.
Question 4
Where does the input data come from when you implement a stress test?

1 / 1 point

You download and use the tests we've prepared to check your solution to the problem.
==You generate valid input data as a part of the stress test implementation.
You enter the input data manually.

5.
Question 5
If you submit a solution of a programming assignment, but it does not pass some of the tests, what feedback will you get from the system?

If it is one of the first few tests, you will see the input data, the answer of your program and the correct answer. Otherwise, you will only see either that the answer of your program is wrong or that your program is too slow or that your program uses too much memory.


incorrect
You will also learn what was the problem: did your program output a wrong answer, or did it work too long, or did it consume too much memory. For the first few tests, you will also see the input data, the output of your program and the correct answer.
